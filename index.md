I specialize in the integration of multimodal understanding and generative models, with a particular emphasis on enhancing the capabilities of autoregressive models for generating and interpreting continuous data, such as images, videos, and 3D content. My expertise extends to large-scale cluster training, involving the deployment of hundreds to thousands of GPUs, and I have played a key role in the training of foundational text-to-image and text-to-video models. In addition, I have conducted in-depth research in areas including AIGC, federated learning, and robotics, with several publications in prestigious conferences within these domains.
